'''
Implements base class for memory elements.

Note that since both DataMemory and InstructionMemory are subclasses of the Memory
class, they will read the same memory file containing both instructions and data
memory initially, but the two memory elements are treated separately, each with its
own, isolated copy of the data from the memory file.
